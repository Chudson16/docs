```````````````````````

**Options:** *none |  camera |  camera+sun*

Set the radiometric calibration to perform on images. When processing multispectral and thermal images you should set this option to obtain reflectance/temperature values (otherwise you will get digital number values). [camera] applies black level, vignetting, row gradient gain/exposure compensation (if appropriate EXIF tags are found) and computes absolute temperature values. [camera+sun] is experimental, applies all the corrections of [camera], plus compensates for spectral radiance registered via a downwelling light sensor (DLS) taking in consideration the angle of the sun. . Default: ``none``
