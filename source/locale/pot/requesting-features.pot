msgid "All software needs user feedback and feature requests, to grow and maintain alignment with the needs of its users."

msgid "OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful ones feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know what a reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel very resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity overload."

#: ../../requesting-features.rst:13
msgid "A feature request can be submitted as issues on the applicable Github repository (e.g., `WebODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues>`_ or `ODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues>`_ or similar) or more simply as a discussion topic on `the community forum <https://community.opendronemap.org/>`_. Try to start by searching these sources to see if someone else has already brought it up.  Sometimes a feature is already in the works, or has at least been discussed."

msgid "To request the addition of support for new drone cameras: please share a set of test images on the `datasets channel on the forum <https://community.opendronemap.org/c/datasets/10>`_. Without test images there's not much the developers can do."

msgid "And importantly, the trick is to listen: if someone within the project says: \"This is a big lift, we need MONEY or TIME or SOMEONE TO HELP CODE IT\" (or possibly a combination of the three) then there are two answers that work really well in response:"

msgid "*Ok. I didn’t know it was a big feature request! I hope someone comes along with the necessary resources. As a community member, I would be happy to be an early user and tester!*"
