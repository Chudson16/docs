msgid "A Ground Control Point (GCP) is a position measurement made on the ground, typically using a high precision GPS. (Toffanin 2019)"

msgid "Ground control points can be set existing structures like pavement corners, lines on a parking lot or contrasting color floor tiles, otherwise can be set using targets placed on the ground."

#: ../../gcp.rst:19
msgid "Procure an evenly horizontal distribution of the GCPs within the project, covering high and low elevations. A minimum of 5 GCP works for most of the jobs, and for larger projects 8 – 10 are sufficient. Locate some points near the corners and others in the center, considering that GCP spacing should be larger than the image footprint so that you can’t see more than one GCP in a single image."

#: ../../gcp.rst:21
msgid "In order to ensure each GCP are found in at least 5 images, separate the points 10 to 30 meters from the perimeter of the project. This distance is dependent of the overlapping, so increasing overlapping should reduce the required distance from the perimeter."
