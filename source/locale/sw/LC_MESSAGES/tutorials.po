"Camera calibration is a special challenge with commodity cameras. "
"Temperature changes, vibrations, focus, and other factors can affect the "
"derived parameters with substantial effects on resulting data. Automatic "
"or self calibration is possible and desirable with drone flights, but "
"depending on the flight pattern, automatic calibration may not remove all"
" distortion from the resulting products. James and Robson (2014) in their"
" paper `Mitigating systematic error in topographic models derived from "
"UAV and ground‐based image networks "
"<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.3609>`_ address how"

"To mitigate this effect, there are a few options but the simplest are as "
