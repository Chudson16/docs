"OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are "
"interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful "
"ones feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know "
"what a reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel"
" very resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity "
"overload."

"OpenDroneMap ni FOSS programu. Free and open source (FOSS) mradi wa "
"kupendeza kutoka ndani na nje: kutoka nje, mafanikio zaidi hasa kama "

"**Demanding that a feature be implemented is probably not going to "
"convince the development team to do so**. Imagine if somebody knocked on "
"your door and asked you to \"stop reading this page right now and come to"
" my house to cook me dinner!\". Your first response might very reasonably"
" be \"who on earth is this person and why should I spend my time and "
"energy fulfilling his agenda instead of my own?\"."

"**Suggesting** that a feature be implemented is a more effective (and "
"cordial) way to ask for new features, especially if you're prepared to "
"offer some of your own resources (time, funds or both) to help get the "
"feature implemented. Explaining why *your* suggestion can benefit others "
"can also help. If the feature benefits you exclusively, it might be "
"harder to convince others to do the work for you."

"A feature request can be submitted as issues on the applicable Github "
"repository (e.g., `WebODM "
"<https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues>`_ or `ODM "
"<https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues>`_ or similar) or more simply"
" as a discussion topic on `the community forum "

"sources to see if someone else has already brought it up.  Sometimes a "
"feature is already in the works, or has at least been discussed."

"And importantly, the trick is to listen: if someone within the project "
"says: \"This is a big lift, we need MONEY or TIME or SOMEONE TO HELP CODE"
" IT\" (or possibly a combination of the three) then there are two answers"
" that work really well in response:"
msgstr ""
"Muhimu zaidi, njia ni kusikia: kiwa mtu ndani ya mradi kasema: \"Huu ni "

"uwezekano wa hizo tatu) kisha kuna majibu mawili yanayofanya kazi vizuri "
