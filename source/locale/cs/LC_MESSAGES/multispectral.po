"Since version 0.9.9 ODM has basic support for radiometric normalization, "
"which is able to generate reflectance orthophotos from multispectral "
"cameras. Multispectral cameras capture multiple shots of the scene using "
"different band sensors."

"Process all the images from all bands at once (do not separate the bands "
"into multiple folders) and pass the `--radiometric-calibration` parameter"
" to enable radiometric normalization. If the images are part of a multi-"
"camera setup, the resulting orthophoto will have N bands, one for each "
"camera (+ alpha)."
