msgid "Can I process two or more orthophoto GeoTIFFs to stitch them together?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:12
msgid ""
"No. ODM is a photogrammetric pipeline and orthophotos do not have the "
"necessary camera information since the images have already been "
"orthorectified. You can use another program such as `Hugin "
"<http://hugin.sourceforge.net/>`_ to do that."

"The software is not using all of my CPU cores / memory / GPU all of the "
"times. Is it normal?"

#, python-format
msgid ""
"Yes. The software tries to use all available resources, when possible, "
"but not always. It's normal to see 10-15% resource utilization at several"
" moments during processing."

"If I use the native version of the software, how can I allocate more "

#: ../../faq.rst:22
msgid ""
"No need; the native (non-docker) version of the software alredy uses all "
"available resources."

"Configure a swapfile. In both Windows and Linux you will need preferably "

"If you are using Windows with `Docker+WSL2 "
"<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/>`_ you can add two rows in "
