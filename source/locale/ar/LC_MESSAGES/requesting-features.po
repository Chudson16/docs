"OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are "
"interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful "
"ones feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know "
"what a reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel"
" very resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity "
"overload."

"A feature request can be submitted as issues on the applicable Github "
"repository (e.g., `WebODM "
"<https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues>`_ or `ODM "
"<https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues>`_ or similar) or more simply"
" as a discussion topic on `the community forum "
"<https://community.opendronemap.org/>`_. Try to start by searching these "
"sources to see if someone else has already brought it up.  Sometimes a "
"feature is already in the works, or has at least been discussed."

"And importantly, the trick is to listen: if someone within the project "
"says: \"This is a big lift, we need MONEY or TIME or SOMEONE TO HELP CODE"
" IT\" (or possibly a combination of the three) then there are two answers"
" that work really well in response:"
