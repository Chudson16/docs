msgid "Starting with ODM version ``0.6.0`` you can split up very large datasets into manageable chunks (called submodels), running the pipeline on each chunk, and then producing merged DEMs, orthophotos and point clouds. The process is referred to as \"split-merge\"."

# d9c8c75065dd42609d41913e7a033206
msgid "Why might you use the split-merge pipeline? If you have a very large number of images in your dataset, split-merge will help make the processing more manageable on a large machine (it will require less memory). If you have many machines all connected to the same network you can also process the submodels in parallel, thus allowing for horizontal scaling and processing thousands of images more quickly."

We recommend using the ``image_groups.txt`` file to accurately control the submodel split when using GCPs."
