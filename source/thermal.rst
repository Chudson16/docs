Thermal Support
===============

ODM has support for radiometric calibration of thermal data, which is able to generate temperature orthophotos from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras. LWIR images can be processed alone or as part of a multispectral dataset.

Hardware
--------

While we aim to support as many cameras as possible, thermal support has been developed using the following cameras, so they will work better:

 * `MicaSense Altum <https://www.micasense.com/>`_
 * `DJI Zenmuse XT <https://www.dji.com/zenmuse-xt>`_
 * `DJI Zenmuse H20 Series <https://enterprise.dji.com/zenmuse-h20-series>`_

Other cameras might also work. You can help us expand this list by `sharing datasets <https://community.opendronemap.org/c/datasets/10>`_ captured with other cameras.

Usage
-----

Process the images using the `--radiometric-calibration camera` parameter to enable radiometric calibration.
